        <p align="right" style="width:auto" font-style="Helvetica">On April 28th, 2018, our interest group was recognized as a Colony for Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity. While there were many “firsts” for the group during the early times, we started creating traditions that would bring a newly discovered quality to our family. As our colony approached the goal of getting installed as a chapter, we grew and thrived with it while creating a lasting legacy on our community.</p>

        <h2 align = "left"> PHI EPSILON CHAPTER</h2>
        <p align="left" style="width:auto" font-style="Helvetica">After three years of blood, sweat, and tears, the CSUF Colony was installed as the Phi Epsilon chapter of Theta Tau on February 2nd, 2020. The Fraternity’s 3 Pillars of Service, Professionalism, and Brotherhood is what we strived for and based our core values on. No matter the amount of contribution everyone put in, every second ounce was necessary for us to reach our goal and achieve Chapter Status. Now we look forward to continuing our traditions and keep expanding our horizons.</p>
